## Introduction

Deepfake technology has rapidly evolved over the past few years, enabling the creation of hyper-realistic but entirely synthetic media. While deepfakes have gained notoriety due to their potential for misuse, they also offer intriguing possibilities for educational applications. From creating realistic simulations to generating customized learning experiences, deepfakes can be a powerful tool when used ethically and responsibly.

**DeepFakeEdu** is designed to explore these dual aspects of deepfakes in education. This project not only demonstrates how deepfake technology can be applied in educational settings but also provides resources to help identify and mitigate potential risks associated with its misuse.

## Features

- **Deepfake Generation Tools**: Scripts and resources to create deepfake videos for educational purposes, such as virtual historical re-enactments, language learning aids, and more.
  
- **Detection Mechanisms**: Tools and methodologies to detect and analyze deepfakes, helping educators and students differentiate between authentic and manipulated media.
  
- **Ethical Guidelines**: Comprehensive guidelines and best practices for the ethical use of deepfakes in educational settings.

- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples and scenarios where deepfakes have been used effectively in education, alongside analyses of the outcomes.

- **Research and Insights**: A collection of academic papers, articles, and resources that delve into the implications of deepfake technology in the educational sphere.

## Installation

To use the tools and resources provided in this repository, follow the steps below to set up your local environment.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RohishAngawlkar/deepfakeedu.git
   cd deepfakeedu
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Verify installation**:
   Ensure that the installation was successful by running a simple test script provided in the repository:
   ```bash
   python test_installation.py
   ```

## Usage

This repository is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose related to deepfake technology in education. Below is a basic guide on how to use the different components of the project.

1. **Deepfake Generation**:
   - Navigate to the `deepfake_generation` directory.
   - Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within that directory to generate your own deepfake videos for educational purposes.

2. **Detection Tools**:
   - The `detection_tools` directory contains scripts and models designed to identify deepfake content.
   - Run the detection tools on sample videos provided or on your custom videos to see how effectively they can identify manipulated media.

3. **Ethical Guidelines and Case Studies**:
   - Access the `resources` directory for detailed guidelines on the ethical use of deepfake technology.
   - The `case_studies` sub-directory offers insights and analysis on various educational scenarios involving deepfakes.

4. **Contributing to the Research**:
   - If you're interested in contributing to the ongoing research, the `research` directory contains open issues and topics that could benefit from further investigation.
